# children-Foundation

This is the Front-End code of the development of a local children non-profit Foundation's website.

Technologies used:
-Grunt (Task Runner)
	-postcss autoprefixer plugin
    -watch plugin
-Sass (CSS pre-processor)
-Jquery
-AngularJS

### AngularJS Version

There is a not-merged branch which stores the project with a full AngularJS implementation, the decision to not merge this version and use it as the final product is based on different reasons:
-The foundation is in its early beginnings and the structure of the website might change in a very short term.
-SEO. the website must be up and running asap, and SEO with Angular is a bit more complicated than traditional html, css, jquery webistes. [AngularJS and SEO](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2012/11/angularjs-and-seo.html)
-The back-end Application to manage the News section does use AngularJS

As a final review of the project, Angular is still used in some parts of the project but the full implementation will be kept as it is until a more mature version of the website is needed.
